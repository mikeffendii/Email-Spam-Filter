# Email-Spam-Filter

Spam Email Detector detect unsolicited, unwanted, and virus-infested email (called spam) and stop it from getting into email inboxes. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use spam filters to make sure they aren't distributing spam.

In this project I've used Naive Base for the classification of Emails whether they're Spam or Ham.
